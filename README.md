This repository contains a python implementation of the SMC algorithm described in our master's project for the Msc in Data Science Methodology at the Barcelona School of Economics.

The repository is organized as follows:
- `alasmc` contains the code as well as the tests.
- `experiments` contains code to run experiments that test the functioning of the algorithm as described in the paper.
- `paper` contains the final writeup of our master's project.
